To build from source using npm or yarn, download the source code and simply install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`, then run the build routine with `npm run tauri build` or `yarn tauri build`

None of the installers are signed so you will likely have to bypass security features to use them. If you do not want to do that, you can build from source as above.
